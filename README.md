# SunLife

Hackathon Project at ConUHacks for SunLife. Our team decided to do an full stack web app that helps clients with SunLife with their financial decisions. We have implemented numerous calculators that helps clients calculate their mortgage, car payments, loan payments etc. We have also added an AI chat bot that the client can use at any time to communicate with SunLife about their financial questions. We have also added an contact form if the client needs help with a certain insurance.
